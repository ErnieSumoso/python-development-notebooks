You will notice the cultural differences, and will find out what makes your culture unique. After retrurning from a long journey, you will see your country with new eyes.\"\"\",\n",

You will be able to observe how you react in completely new situations. You will test your language, orientational and social skills. You will not be the same person after returning home.During travelling you will meet people that are very different from you.

You may try activities that you have never tried before.Travelling will inevitably make you more independent and confident. You will realise that you can cope with a lot of unexpected situations.
